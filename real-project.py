# plan:
# - make a maze where the user's mouse is tracked
# - use pixels to draw the maze with multiple traps, but not too
#   difficult resulting in the user failing from trying to take normal path
# - make the user lose and restart if a wall (filled pixel) is touched
# - make multiple levels of the maze, and allow each to have
#   a level of difficulty from easy to hard
# - make a win/lose message
# - possibly add a timed gamemode
