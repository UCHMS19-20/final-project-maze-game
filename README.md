# MAZE GAME README

* This maze game allows you to move a yellow box through many obstacles to the finish. The walls are not the only obstacles; some paths are not wide enough to allow the block to pass through. If the block hits the wall, the game is over and there is a lose message. There are three levels of difficulty, and each different level corresponds to a different speed of the yellow block. If the block hits the finish line in the bottom right corner of the maze, the game ends with a win message.
